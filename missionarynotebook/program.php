<p class="medium-font">The Mission Church's Missions Program sends out 20-30 new Missionaries each year to various locations all over the world. Missionaries typically serve in the Missions field for one year, but we have Missionaries who have served for five or more years.</p>
<p class="medium-font">The goal of the program is to help struggling communities become self sustaining. We provide help in many forms such as medical, education, and finacial. We also hope to spread Jesus' message to areas where there is little to no exposure with spirituality or religion.</p>
<p class="medium-font">Although we don't actively recruit new Missionaries, we encourage those who might be interested to join one of our informational meetings and attend a Missions related event. Working in the Missions field is difficult, it is a calling that must be reflected upon with prayer and discernment.</p>
    <p class="medium-font">We invite you to learn more about our Missions Program, visit the Missions Church and come back to the Missionary Notebook website to read the latest posts from the Missionaries and keep posted on the latest events.</p>
