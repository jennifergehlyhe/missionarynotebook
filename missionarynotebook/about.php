<p class="medium-font">The Missionary Notebook is a project run by the Missions Church. Our goal is to promote our Missions Program that sends Missionaries to various locations all over the world. The work that they do is priceless to the communities that they serve, offering help, support, education, medical services and makeshift housing.</p>
    <p class="medium-font">The main focus of this website is to highlight and celebrate the lives of Missionaries engaging in working in the Missions field. Missionaries upload photo, video, audio and text content to share with the Parishioners of Missions Church and with the general public.</p>
    <p class="medium-font">The second goal of the website is to help raise money to sustain the Missionaries as they work with communities. We encourage donations through our donations page, and 100% of the proceeds through our online store go to helping to support the Missions Program.</p>
    <p class="medium-font">Thanks for visiting the Missionary Notebook and we hope you come visit us again.
