The Missions Map shows the locations of many of the Missionaries currently serving all over the world through the Mission Church's Missions Program. The map also shows places of worship, Missionary Organizations, medical and education facilities that are in partnership with the Mission Church or whose purpose is to serve communities in need.</p>
