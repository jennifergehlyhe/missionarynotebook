    <h2>From Mariah's Journal: Inspired To Encourage </h2>
    <p class="medium-font">So, I suddenly feel inspired (give God the glory) to do a 30 days of encouragement challenge. Basically, I don’t know if that exists, but I want to try to encourage someone (most likely a believer) every day for 30 days with a specific scripture. The reason? I feel inspired by Hebrews 3:12-13, “See to it, brothers,” [i.e. “Christians”] “that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.”

    <h2>From Mariah's Journal: An Indentity Crisis</h2>
    <p class="medium-font">I feel like I’ve been going through an identity crisis. I feel like I’m becoming a shell with hollow shadowy nothing inside.
	...Although I really enjoy and love hanging out with my roommates, there have been things I’ve lost because I’ve made compromises with myself. I think the biggest thing I’ve lost has been joy. My middle name is Joy and I used to not think anything of it until a year or so ago I began to see how god had made that a huge characteristic of me. I feel like I’ve lost that, though. I smile and laugh still, but it is not the same. If I currently only smiled or laughed when I truly felt happy, joyful, or amused, I don’t think I would laugh or smile that much, and that’s a really awful feeling. I think I’ve kept up smiling and laughing because I so badly want joy, but I don’t have it right now. It’s not just been with my roommates, but also at my church too. I’ve been putting up a facade of worshipping passionately, smiling, greeting others, but I haven’t actually felt that inside.
